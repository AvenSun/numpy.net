This project contains unit tests for the NumpyLib layer
of the numpy.net solution.  Effectively this lower
layer that does all of the heavy data manipulation.

This code was ported from the C based numpy library
in the original python implementation.

It's primary purpose is to exercise and verify that
some of the primitive functions of that library are
working correctly.
