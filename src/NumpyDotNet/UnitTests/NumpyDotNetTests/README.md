This project contains unit tests for the NumpyDotNet layer
of the numpy.net solution.  Effectively this is the numpy API
layer that applications will interface to.

There are matching python based unit tests in the 
	\numpy.net\src\PythonUnitTests directory.

The output generated by those tests should be reproducable by
the output generated by these tests and we use Asserts to
verify that.
