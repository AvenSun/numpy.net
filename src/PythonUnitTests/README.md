This project contains python Numpy unit tests that are used as the comparison for

\numpy.net\src\NumpyDotNet\UnitTests\NumpyDotNetTests

You will find that there is a 1 to 1 matching of unit test named between the two different solutions.
Typically I implemented the unit test in python, captured the output, implemented the same unit test in C#
and then used the output as the Asserts in .NET.
